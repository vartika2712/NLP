SOLUTIONS.

1. Applications for different types of RNNs:
- Sequence-to-sequence RNN: This type of RNN is commonly used in machine translation, where it takes a sequence of words in one language and generates a sequence of words in another language. It can also be applied to speech recognition, text summarization, and chatbot systems.
- Sequence-to-vector RNN: This type of RNN is often used in sentiment analysis, where it takes a sequence of words as input and produces a single vector representing the sentiment of the input sequence. It can also be used for document classification, where the input is a sequence of words and the output is a vector representing the category of the document.
- Vector-to-sequence RNN: This type of RNN is useful in tasks such as image captioning, where it takes an input vector (e.g., an image representation) and generates a sequence of words describing the image. It can also be used in music generation, where a vector representation of musical attributes can be transformed into a sequence of musical notes.

2. Encoder-decoder RNNs are preferred over plain sequence-to-sequence RNNs for automatic translation because they can handle variable-length input and output sequences. In machine translation, the length of the input sentence can vary, and an encoder-decoder architecture allows the model to encode the input sequence into a fixed-size representation (context vector) and then decode it into the target sequence. The encoder captures the meaning of the input sentence, while the decoder generates the translated sentence. This flexibility in handling variable-length sequences makes encoder-decoder RNNs more suitable for translation tasks.

3. To classify videos using a combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and an RNN, you can follow a two-step process. First, you use the CNN to extract spatial features from individual video frames. The CNN analyzes each frame and captures visual patterns. Then, you pass the extracted features from the CNN into an RNN, such as an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), which takes the temporal dynamics into account. The RNN processes the sequence of extracted features from the CNN and learns temporal dependencies over time, enabling video classification based on the combined spatial and temporal information.

4. The advantages of using `dynamic_rnn()` over `static_rnn()` in TensorFlow (assuming we are comparing TensorFlow implementations) are:
- `dynamic_rnn()` can handle variable-length sequences, whereas `static_rnn()` requires fixed-length sequences. This is important for tasks where the length of the input sequences may vary.
- `dynamic_rnn()` automatically performs the unrolling of the RNN over the time steps, based on the actual sequence lengths. This can improve computational efficiency by avoiding unnecessary calculations for padding elements.
- `dynamic_rnn()` allows for the use of dynamic batch sizes. It means that the batch size can vary from step to step, which is useful in scenarios where each example has a different sequence length.

5. Variable-length input sequences can be dealt with by padding the sequences to a fixed length. In this approach, shorter sequences are padded with special tokens (e.g., zeros) to match the length of the longest sequence in the dataset. Alternatively, you can use techniques like bucketing, where you group similar-length sequences together and create separate batches for each bucket.

For variable-length output sequences, you can use techniques like teacher forcing, where during training, the model is fed with the true output sequence as input at each time step, regardless of its own predictions. During inference, the model generates the output sequence step by step by feeding its own predictions from the previous step as input. Another approach is to use a special end-of-sequence token and let the model generate output until it predicts the end token.

6. A common way to distribute training and execution of a deep RNN across multiple GPUs is to use parallel computing techniques. This involves splitting the RNN model across the GPUs and distributing the computations. One common approach is to use data parallelism, where each GPU processes a subset of the input data and computes gradients independently. These gradients are then synchronized and averaged across the GPUs to update the model parameters. Frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch provide APIs and tools to facilitate distributed training across multiple GPUs, such as `tf.distribute.Strategy` in TensorFlow and `torch.nn.DataParallel` in PyTorch.
